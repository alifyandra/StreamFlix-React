This is my very first time learning and touching React.js as well as JavaScript testing, so do forgive some rustiness in the code as I still have plenty of room for improvementðŸ˜…. Given the 3 days to complete this mini project, it was very fun and it forced me to learn a lot about React.js very quickly given the short time frame.
